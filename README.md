# ADV Ride Report De-Crufter

A greasemonkey script for advrider.com to only show the original poster's posts in a thread

## Usage

To filter a thread, click the checkbox next to "Only show OP's posts?"

To see all posts in a thread, uncheck the checkbox.

The script will automatically remember which threads you've chosen to filter. This is done using cookies, so if you clear your cookies your settings will be reset.

### Exceptions

You can add users to an exceptions list on a per-thread basis. This allows for tidy group ride threads -- now you can see just the posts belonging to the group ride members.

Click `edit` to add usernames to the exception list. Multiple usernames are allowed; separate them with commas.

Click `clear` to reset the exception list.

The script will automatically remember your exception lists. This is done using cookies, so if you clear your cookies your settings will be reset.
